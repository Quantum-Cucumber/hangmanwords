# Hangman Wordlist

This is a wordlist used for the r/teamagers discord "Teamagers Bot" hangman game

The wordlist was originally downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt), filtered to only contain words of a certain length (5-10 characters long), then handsorted to remove proper nouns (names, place names, company names) and other words deemed either too difficult/mispelt/innapropriate

The intent for this repo is to allow users to help remove words that shouldn't be kept, ~6k words is a LOT so mistakes have very likely been made when filtering.

Contributing: Add a pull request if you want, otherwise you can add an issue - just make sure to include the line# and the word(s) that needs to be removed :)
